Chili is a hearty and flavorful dish that is perfect for any occasion. Whether you're looking for a quick lunch or a comforting dinner, chili is the answer. But what about pairing it with other foods? In this blog post, we'll explore the best options for what to eat with chili.

## Cornbread

Cornbread is a classic accompaniment to chili, and for good reason. The sweetness of the cornbread balances out the spiciness of the chili, creating a perfect balance of flavors. The texture of the cornbread also adds a nice contrast to the thick and chunky chili. You can either crumble the cornbread on top of the chili or enjoy it on the side.

## Rice

Rice is another great option to pair with chili. It not only adds a bit of bulk to the dish, but also helps to soak up the flavorful sauce. White rice is a popular choice, but you can also try pairing chili with brown rice for a healthier option. For a twist, you can even cook the rice with some chili powder and cumin to infuse it with even more flavor.

## Avocado

Avocado may seem like an unconventional pairing for chili, but trust us, it works. The creamy and cool avocado helps to balance out the spiciness of the chili, making it a perfect match. You can either slice or dice the avocado and add it on top of the chili or serve it on the side as a refreshing side dish.

## Corn Chips

If you're looking for a crunchy element to add to your chili, corn chips are the way to go. The salty and crispy chips add a nice texture to the dish and also help to soak up the flavorful sauce. Plus, they make for a tasty and fun way to eat your chili. You can either dip the chips into the chili or crush them up and sprinkle them on top.

## Salad

For a lighter option, consider pairing chili with a fresh salad. The crisp and refreshing greens help to balance out the richness of the chili. You can stick with a simple garden salad or get creative and add some southwestern flavors, like corn, black beans, and avocado. The combination of hot and cold also adds an interesting contrast to the meal.

In conclusion, there are many delicious options for what to eat with chili. Whether you prefer something sweet, savory, or crunchy, there is a perfect pairing for your chili dish. So next time you're making chili, consider trying
