### Sleek Sophistication
For a more polished look, tuck your peasant blouse into high-waisted trousers. Opt for neutral shades like black or navy, and add a pair of sleek loafers or ankle boots. Finish the look with a structured handbag and minimalistic jewelry, ideal for casual Fridays at the office or a dinner date.

Combine your peasant blouse with classic blue jeans for an effortlessly chic vibe. Choose distressed jeans for a more relaxed look or dark wash jeans for a bit more elegance. Add some leather sandals and a crossbody bag for a stroll around town or running errands.

### Layered Chic
When the temperatures drop, layer your peasant blouse with a cozy oversized cardigan or a denim jacket. Go for warm tones like mustard or burgundy for the cardigan, and pair with leggings or fitted pants. Complement this look with ankle boots and a chunky scarf—perfect for fall excursions or casual family gatherings.

### Festival Ready
Embrace the festival spirit by teaming your peasant blouse with denim shorts and ankle boots. Add a wide-brimmed hat, layered necklaces, and fringe accessories for an outfit that screams free-spirited. Ideal for concerts, outdoor events, or leisurely weekend activities.
