## Outfit Ideas for Sequin Top

### Casual Glam: Jeans and Sneakers
Pairing a sequin top with your favorite jeans and a pair of clean white sneakers is an effortless way to capture the casual chic vibe. Choose jeans in a classic blue or go bold with black skinnies for a more polished look. Accessorize with simple stud earrings and a crossbody bag to keep the outfit relaxed yet stylish. 

### Sophisticated Shine: Pencil Skirt and Heels
For a more refined look, consider wearing your sequin top with a sleek pencil skirt. Opt for a neutral skirt to balance out the glitz, and finish with nude or black heels for a classic touch. Add a statement necklace and a chic clutch to transition seamlessly from desk to dinner.

### Laid-Back Luxe: Wide-Leg Trousers and Sandals
Wide-leg trousers bring a touch of elegance and comfort when styled with a sequin top. Choose a monochrome color palette or experiment with subtle patterns. Metallic sandals and oversized sunglasses add a dash of glamour, perfect for brunch with friends or a day at the gallery.

### Edgy Appeal: Leather Jacket and Ankle Boots
Adding a leather jacket to your sequin top instantly introduces an edgy element to your outfit. Dark washes or distressed jeans complement this look, while a pair of ankle boots adds height and attitude. Finish with statement hoop earrings for that rockstar appeal.

### Elegant Evening: Maxi Skirt and Statement Earrings
Elevate your sequin top for a night out by pairing it with a flowy maxi skirt. Select a classic color like black or navy to let the sequins shine. Complement with statement earrings and strappy heels to complete your evening ensemble. Perfect for weddings or upscale gatherings.
