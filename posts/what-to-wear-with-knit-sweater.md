A statement necklace or a colorful scarf can bring the whole look together, adding a pop of personality.

### Layered Lookbook Elegance
For those breezy yet unpredictable days, layer your knit sweater over a crisp button-up shirt. Choose a slim pencil skirt or tailored trousers to balance the cozy top layer and maintain a sleek silhouette. Add minimalistic jewelry and a structured handbag to keep this ensemble office-appropriate.
