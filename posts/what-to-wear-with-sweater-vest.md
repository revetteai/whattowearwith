This is one of the best outfits for sweater vest in cooler weather.

### Professional Edge: Button-Up Shirt and Trousers
Who says office attire canâ€™t be fun? Wear your sweater vest over a crisp white button-up shirt and pair it with tailored trousers. Choose a monochrome color scheme or explore different textures, like wool or cotton blends, for an elevated look. Finish off with loafers or ankle boots, and you're ready to tackle that meeting in style!

### Playful Patterns: Printed Skirt and Ankle Boots
Inject some fun into your wardrobe by pairing a solid-colored sweater vest with a printed skirt. A midi skirt works best for a balanced silhouette. Complete the look with ankle boots to add an extra flair of sophistication. This is a fantastic outfit idea when you're figuring out how to style sweater vest for a night out with friends.

### Comfy and Cozy: Leggings and Oversized Sweater Vest
For a cozy and comfy outfit, wear an oversized sweater vest with a pair of leggings. This look is ideal for lazy weekends or a coffee run. Try playing with textures by choosing faux leather leggings and pairing them with combat boots for a trendy twist. Add a crossbody bag to keep it functional yet stylish.
