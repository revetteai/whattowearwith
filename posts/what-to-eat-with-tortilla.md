Tortillas are a versatile staple in Mexican cuisine, commonly used to make tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. But have you ever wondered what else you can pair with this delicious flatbread? Look no further, as we explore the best foods to eat with tortillas.

## Avocado

Avocado and tortilla make for a match made in heaven. The creamy texture and subtle flavor of avocado complement the soft and slightly chewy texture of a tortilla. Mash up some ripe avocados and spread it on top of a warm tortilla for a tasty and healthy snack. You can also add some diced tomatoes, onions, and cilantro for a refreshing twist.

## Black Beans

Black beans are a staple in Latin American cuisine and pair perfectly with tortillas. The earthy and slightly nutty flavor of black beans balances out the subtle flavors of the tortilla. Spread a layer of refried black beans on top of a tortilla and top it off with some shredded cheese, salsa, and sour cream for a delicious and filling meal.

## Grilled Chicken

Grilled chicken is a classic pairing with tortillas, and for a good reason. The smoky and savory flavors of the grilled chicken complement the mild flavor of the tortilla. Slice up some grilled chicken and add it to your tortilla along with some lettuce, tomatoes, and your favorite sauce for a quick and satisfying meal.

## Salsa

No tortilla dish is complete without a side of salsa. The tangy and spicy flavors of salsa add a burst of flavor to any dish. Whether you prefer a chunky pico de gallo or a smooth and spicy salsa verde, the combination of tortilla and salsa is a match made in heaven.

## Cheese

Last but not least, we have cheese. Whether it's shredded cheddar, crumbled queso fresco, or creamy cotija, cheese and tortillas are a classic combination. The gooey and melty cheese adds a satisfying texture to a warm and soft tortilla. Use it as a filling for quesadillas or sprinkle it on top of tacos for a delicious finish.

So next time you're wondering what to make with your tortillas, remember these tasty pairings. Whether you're in the mood for something savory, spicy, or refreshing, there's always a perfect food to eat with tortillas.
