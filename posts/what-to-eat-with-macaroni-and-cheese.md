## Bacon

Bacon and Macaroni and Cheese are a match made in heaven. The smoky, salty flavor of bacon complements the rich and creamy cheese sauce perfectly. Simply cook some bacon until crispy and sprinkle it on top of your mac and cheese for a delicious twist.

## Broccoli

## Buffalo Chicken

For those who like a little spice, buffalo chicken is the perfect pairing for mac and cheese. The tangy and spicy flavors of buffalo sauce cut through the richness of the cheese sauce, creating a delicious balance. You can either mix shredded buffalo chicken into your mac and cheese or serve it on the side for dipping.

## Roasted Vegetables

Roasted vegetables, such as carrots, zucchini, and bell peppers, add some color, flavor, and texture to your mac and cheese. Simply toss your desired vegetables in olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast them in the oven until tender. Then mix them into your mac and cheese for a hearty and satisfying meal.
